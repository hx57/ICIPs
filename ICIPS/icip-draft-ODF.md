## Simple Summary
Idea of creating an official discussion forum maintained by the ICON Foundation which can be exclusively edited by $ICX owners but read only by the wide public without $ICX.

## Motivation
About a month ago I bumped into the NEX Community platform which is open to read but need NEX Extension and $NEX token for registration and contribution. The NEX leaders regulary show up in the threads and give first hand information about the issues, questions, etc.

I think ICX has a great community and should have an official, well structured actively maintained community platform too where the community, the real owners, investors can raise questions, suggestions and has place for brainstromings.

Recently I don't know any community platform for ICX where there is place for these kind of dialogues with well educated opinion leaders, members, developers, marketers etc. Yes there are twitter accounts I can follow, there are forums where the information shows up then sinks, there are unofficial TG channels but I think we "deserve" more. Maybe not tomorrow but in few months. 

Sorry I know it is only an idea and not a perfect ICIP but I just wanted to leave this here.

## Actions needed

1. Choose domain, implement forum engine (Discourse seems to be good) and design it to be responsive
2. Develop an app to use $ICX wallet for registration/login and voting.
3. Select the team: leaders who will give answers, administrators, social marketing expert with fresh news
4. Put together the main knowledge base and content

## A probably good example
